 The Maximally-Localised Generalised Wannier Functions Code

This directory containes the subroutines for post-processing 
a pwscf calculation for use with Wannier90.

In general, the releases of quantum-espresso and those of 
Wannier90 are out of sync. Therefore, we provide here a copy 
of the post-processing routine that is compatible with this
release of Wannier90 and a particular release of quantum-espresso.

====
v5.0
====

Within, e.g., the sub-directory v5.0 you will find the file pw2wannier90.f90

Copy pw2wannier90.f90 to the PP/src directory of the quantum-espresso distribution, replacing the
file of the same name that is already there. Then you should compile pw2wannier90.x as normal.



===================
versions before 5.0
===================

Within, e.g., the sub-directory v3.2.3 you will find two files:

1. pw2wannier90.f90 should be copied to the "PP" directory
of v3.2.3 of the quantum-espresso distribution, replacing the 
file of the same name that is already there,

2. wannier.f90 that should be copied to the "Modules" directory
of v3.2.3 of the quantum-espresso distribution, replacing the 
file of the same name that is already there. (note after v5.0
this wannier.f90 is not needed or present)

Then you should compile pw2wannier90.x as normal.
