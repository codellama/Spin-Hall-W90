|      The number of bands has been changed from the values supplied          |
|      in the INCAR file. This is a result of running the parallel version.   |
|      The orbitals not found in the WAVECAR file will be initialized with    |
|      random numbers, which is usually adequate. For correlated              |
|      calculations, however, you should redo the groundstate calculation.    |
